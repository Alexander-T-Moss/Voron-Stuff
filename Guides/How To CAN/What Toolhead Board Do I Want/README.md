<div>The SB2040 is quickly becoming the goto CAN board for people running a clockwork 2 extruder and for good reason. Compared to other CAN boards, the SB2040 integrates really nicely with the CW2 extruder and has many features that are nice to have for a Voron - mainly because out of all the CAN boards, the SB2040 is meant specifically for Voron.</div>

### Advantages

1. Designed specifically for Voron printers
   1. More relevent connections and features
   2. Better integration with CW2
2. Two peice design making toolhead maintance easier

### Disadvantages

1. A few users are having issues with configuring the board - although most issues get sorted in the end
   1. Most of this is down to lack of first party documentation but this is almost a problem for all CAN boards. However there is amazing community documention for these CAN boards!
