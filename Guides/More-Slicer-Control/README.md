# More Slicer Control

In this guide you'll learn the basics of making variables in superslicer along with uitilising them to unlock more control over your printer! I **strongly** recommend you follow through the sections in order for it to make more sense, however if you just need something specific, you can jump to it from the key words glossary :)
