# What The Macro

In this section of my Voron Stuff, you can find all the macros I have on my printer. I've configured them to be "*parametric*" so they *should* **work regardless of your printer's dimensions**.

## How To Setup The Macros

1. Download and uncompress `AllTheMacros.zip`
2. Add a folder in your printers *configuration files* section called `Macros`
3. Put all the files from `AllTheMacros` into the `Macros` folder you created
4. In your `printer.cfg` near the top, add the line: `[include Macros/Macros.cfg]`
5. *Optionally:* In your `WebUI Settings` add some macro groups and organize the macros

**Note:** Make sure non of the macros you've just added have the same name as any you may already have or klipper won't be happy
